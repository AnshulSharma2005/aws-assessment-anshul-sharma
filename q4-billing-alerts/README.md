Cost monitoring is critical for beginners because it’s easy to leave resources running (like NAT Gateways, RDS, or large EC2 instances) and accidentally go beyond the Free Tier. A CloudWatch billing alarm at a low threshold (e.g., near ₹100 equivalent in USD) gives an early signal if costs start to grow. Sudden bill spikes often come from continuously running non-free-tier instances, high data transfer (out to the internet), provisioned databases or EBS volumes, forgetting load balancers/NAT gateways, or enabling expensive managed services (e.g., high-volume S3 PUT/GET, CloudWatch logs, or third-party marketplace AMIs). Having alarms and free tier usage alerts helps catch these issues early before they become a big bill.

Note: Billing metrics and budgets are in USD, not INR. You’ll approximate ₹100 into USD in the threshold (for example ~1.2–1.5 USD depending on rate).

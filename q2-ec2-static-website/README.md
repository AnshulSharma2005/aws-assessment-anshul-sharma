I deployed a Free Tier t2.micro EC2 instance in one of the public subnets created earlier. A security group was configured to allow HTTP (port 80) from the internet and SSH from a restricted CIDR. During instance boot, a user data script installs Nginx, updates the system, and places a static HTML resume page under /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html. The instance has a public IP so the site is directly reachable over port 80. For basic hardening, I limit SSH access, apply OS updates, disable root login over SSH (via default Amazon Linux config), and keep only necessary ports open.

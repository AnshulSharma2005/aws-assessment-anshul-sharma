For high availability, I placed an internet-facing Application Load Balancer in the public subnets and moved the web servers into private subnets. An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) spans both private subnets, so EC2 instances are distributed across multiple AZs. The ALB receives traffic from the internet on port 80 and forwards it to a target group containing the instances launched by the ASG. The instances use a launch template with a similar user data script to install Nginx and serve the resume site. The private instances access the internet (for updates) via the existing NAT Gateway configured in the VPC. This design ensures that if one AZ fails or an instance becomes unhealthy, the ALB and ASG maintain application availability.
